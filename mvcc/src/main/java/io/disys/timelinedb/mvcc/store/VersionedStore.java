 * of creation.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link #writer()}, {@link #compact(long)}, and {@link #sync()} must be driven
 * by a single thread; concurrent invocations have undefined behaviour.</p>

 * <p>Logical commits ({@link Writer#close()}) are immediately visible to new readers.
 * Durability — surviving crashes and restarts — is guaranteed only after
